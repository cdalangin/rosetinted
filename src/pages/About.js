                people to connect and share their lives with the world. People can 
                share a stylish photo, a new achievement, or even just what theyâ€™re 
                doing at the moment. However, it comes to a point where people will 
                exaggerate or alter their posts to appear to live a more successful 
                or desirable life than they really are. This creates harmful and 
                unrealistic expectations, especially for the younger generation, 
                since they will compare their own lives to these posts and feel 
                inadequate. Rose-tinted Glasses is a website that will demonstrate 
                what possibly lies underneath these picture perfect images and remind 
                people that they are exactly where they need to be.</p>
